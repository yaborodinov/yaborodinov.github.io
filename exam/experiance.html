                    <p>For many people, writing about yourself isn’t easy. Whether you’re just starting out in your field, or you have years of
                    experience behind you, figuring out how to describe what you do in a few quick sentences is a challenge.</p>
                    <p>You want to make sure visitors to your site understand your work—but you don’t want to go into too much detail in case
                    they lose interest. You want to mention recognition you’ve received and exciting projects you’ve completed—but you don’t
                    want to seem like you’re bragging.</p>
                    <p>Even if you’ve hit the perfect balance of writing just enough about your professional experience, there’s still the
                    question of how to make your bio stand out from all the others out there. You want to make your “About Me” page
                    memorable and different—but how can you keep things personal without seeming unprofessional?</p>
                    <p>We’ve put together a simple step-by-step guide to creating a biography that works: one that’s personal and professional
                    at the same time, and that can be finished up in seven easy steps.</p>

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Introduce yourself
                                <p>Use the very first line of your “About Me” page to simply tell visitors who you are. Think about how you would introduce
                                yourself to someone who’s asked what you do, and just go from there. Make sure you mention the city you’re based in.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2. Aim for a friendly, casual tone
                                <p>There’s no need to be overly formal on your online portfolio page. This is your own space for representing yourself on
                                the web. Let yourself feel at home, and write your About page the same way you would normally speak.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                3. Decide which professional experience to include
                                <p>Do you want your “About Me” page to include a comprehensive list of past experience which you can utilize as an online
                                resume for prospective employers and clients? Or would you prefer to briefly give an overview of your work and keep the
                                details for specific job applications, or perhaps in a separate page titled “CV”? Decide what works for you.</p>
                                <p>If you’d like your “About Me” page to include a CV, your best bet is to simplify and shorten it up a lot. Your biography
                                should be descriptive, but not too long. Just go for job headings, dates, and a quick description of your work. If you
                                do a lot of commissions or commercial work, you may decide to simply list recent clients or projects.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                4. Consider listing awards and accolades
                                <p>If you’ve been <a href="#">recognized for your work</a>, your “About Me” page is a great place to briefly mention this. Depending on the
                                kind of work you do, client testimonials might be appropriate to include here as well.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                5. Add a few personal details
                                <p>Are you a dog owner? Do you like to paint in your spare time? Do you have a passion for skiing? It may seem
                                unprofessional to include little details like these, but a biography page that only lists work-related information about
                                you isn’t offering a complete introduction. It’s easy to skim through someone’s professional experience and not feel as
                                if you’ve learned anything personal about them. Briefly mentioning something interesting about who you are or what you
                                like to makes your “About Me” page more memorable.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
